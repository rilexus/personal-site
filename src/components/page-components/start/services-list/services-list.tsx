              know best practices from programmer and designer point of view and
              I combine them in my development process.

              Before starting to develop it is essential to understand the needs
              and requirements for the project. Therefore its crucial to
              communicate with stack holders and future users. Only this way its
              possible to develop a valuable solution!

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <ParagraphStyled>
              Design is a repetitive process. To adjust the products
              functionality to the users core needs, it necessary to create
              prototypes and to iterate through design sketches. I’m convinced
              that a quick prototype and a rough sketch always saves a lot of
              development hours.
