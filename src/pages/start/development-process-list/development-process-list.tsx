            <ParagraphStyled>
              Iâ€™m a programmer who knows design. I know best practices from both
              worlds and combine them in frontend development and UX/XD. I work
              close with designers and programmers. I believe that
              communication, constructive criticism a safe team environment are
              the keys to success.

            <ParagraphStyled>
              I am competent in backend technologies as well as frontend and
              design. I work equally well in a team or develop a project
              completely on my own.

            <ParagraphStyled>
              Before starting to develop I make sure I understand the needs and
              requirements for the project. Therefore I ask a lot of questions
              and interview future users.

            <ParagraphStyled>
              After understanding all requirements I sketch out the first design
              and test it for functionality. Then I create a quick prototype. I
              say: "A prototype tells more than 100 sketches"
